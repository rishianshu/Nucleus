2025-12-01T13:20:00Z {done: booting ingestion-strategy-unification-v1, next: review INTENT/SPEC/ACCEPTANCE and current PLAN/TODO, risks: none yet}
2025-12-01T13:28:00Z {done: reviewed INTENT/SPEC/ACCEPTANCE and RUNCARD scope; boot confirmed, next: audit current planners/worker/workflow vs unified design, risks: none yet}
2025-12-01T13:38:00Z {done: audited scope and drafted PLAN/TODO (unified planning, Source→Staging→Sink, CDM registry, GraphQL invariants, tests), next: start planner/worker audit & implementation loop, risks: complexity across Python/TS}
2025-12-01T13:55:00Z {done: audited metadata_worker run_ingestion_unit — still returns records arrays over Temporal and contains Jira/Confluence CDM branches; staging unused, next: design/refactor to staging handles + registry CDM mapping, risks: broad surface change}
2025-12-01T14:35:00Z {done: introduced CDM registry module + staging provider abstraction; metadata_worker now stages records and uses registry-based CDM mapping (no inline Jira/Confluence branches), next: cleanup remaining endpoint-specific helpers and align planners/GraphQL/tests to new staging+registry path, risks: further refactor breadth}
2025-12-01T15:20:00Z {done: endpoint abstraction continuing (removed ingestion registry; worker uses family→runner registry and staging/CDM registries), next: unify planners (list_units/plan_incremental_slices) and GraphQL/workflow to staging+registry path, risks: broad TS/Py test fallout}
2025-12-03T13:29:15Z {done: resuming run, next: read PLAN/TODO/RUNCARD and continue implementation, risks: ongoing surface breadth}
2025-12-03T14:25:00Z {done: wired staging handles (no bulk records) across metadata_worker/TS workflow; added adaptive planners for JDBC/Jira/Confluence with unit test; enforced metadata-first startIngestion errors + tests, next: run TS ingestion tests/ci-check and align remaining sinks/checkpoint handling, risks: possible TS type/test fallout and config-less runs now erroring as disabled}
2025-12-04T02:25:00Z {done: ran pnpm ci-check; TS build passes but Playwright metadata-auth failed (registerEndpoint workflows failing, staging JSON serialization fixed), next: fix Temporal/registerEndpoint failures and rerun ci-check, risks: workflow start errors and metadata DB/seeding gaps}
2025-12-04T09:45:00Z {done: added KB/CDM filter assertions, hardened auth waits; pnpm ci-check now green (metadata-auth + metadata-lifecycle), next: close run and update STATE/STORY, risks: none}
