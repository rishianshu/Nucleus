2025-12-01T13:20:00Z {done: booting ingestion-strategy-unification-v1, next: review INTENT/SPEC/ACCEPTANCE and current PLAN/TODO, risks: none yet}
2025-12-01T13:28:00Z {done: reviewed INTENT/SPEC/ACCEPTANCE and RUNCARD scope; boot confirmed, next: audit current planners/worker/workflow vs unified design, risks: none yet}
2025-12-01T13:38:00Z {done: audited scope and drafted PLAN/TODO (unified planning, Source→Staging→Sink, CDM registry, GraphQL invariants, tests), next: start planner/worker audit & implementation loop, risks: complexity across Python/TS}
2025-12-01T13:55:00Z {done: audited metadata_worker run_ingestion_unit — still returns records arrays over Temporal and contains Jira/Confluence CDM branches; staging unused, next: design/refactor to staging handles + registry CDM mapping, risks: broad surface change}
2025-12-01T14:35:00Z {done: introduced CDM registry module + staging provider abstraction; metadata_worker now stages records and uses registry-based CDM mapping (no inline Jira/Confluence branches), next: cleanup remaining endpoint-specific helpers and align planners/GraphQL/tests to new staging+registry path, risks: further refactor breadth}
2025-12-01T15:20:00Z {done: endpoint abstraction continuing (removed ingestion registry; worker uses family→runner registry and staging/CDM registries), next: unify planners (list_units/plan_incremental_slices) and GraphQL/workflow to staging+registry path, risks: broad TS/Py test fallout}
