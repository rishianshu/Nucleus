2025-12-10T23:40:00Z {done: resumed run context for signals-epp-foundation-v1; verified intents/runs artifacts present, next: follow RUNCARD resume protocol (read PLAN/TODO/last LOG) and continue tasks, risks: none}
2025-12-11T02:35:00Z {done: added signal Prisma models/migration + seeds, SignalStore implementation/tests, GraphQL schema/resolvers, docs, and Playwright coverage; ci-check aborted because Docker daemon unavailable, next: rerun pnpm ci-check after starting Docker to verify end-to-end, risks: CI blocked until Docker/stack can start}
2025-12-11T04:10:00Z {done: fixed TS enum coercion and Prisma transaction typing; adjusted ci-check to run signal store spec via workspace filter, next: rerun pnpm ci-check (Docker now available) to confirm green, risks: pending CI}
