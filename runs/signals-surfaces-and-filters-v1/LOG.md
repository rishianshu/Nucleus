2025-12-11T17:36:17Z {done: started signals-surfaces-and-filters-v1 run; verified intents/runs artifacts present, next: follow RUNCARD resume protocol (read PLAN/TODO/last LOG) and continue tasks, risks: none}
2025-12-11T18:17:42Z {done: extended signals GraphQL with filter/paging + signalsForEntity, added Signals UI console/nav + CDM work/doc signal surfacing hooks, seeded signal helper and UI/Playwright test scaffold, next: finish wiring (state params, doc/work signal cards) and run targeted tests, risks: seed connections or new routes may need adjustments}
2025-12-11T18:25:47Z {done: completed signals UI wiring (doc/work inline cards, nav, state sync) and added seed helper + Playwright test; attempted signal unit tests blocked by tsx EPERM pipe restriction, next: resolve tsx IPC permission or run tests with elevated perms and verify Playwright, risks: tests pending}
2025-12-11T19:14:46Z {done: fixed signal store paging filters; signal unit tests now passing and api build succeeds after type guard updates, next: run Playwright (signals-ui + metadata-auth) if environment allows and validate end-to-end, risks: Playwright not yet executed}
2025-12-11T17:53:47Z {done: resumed signals-surfaces-and-filters-v1 run; reviewed PLAN/TODO/LOG/sync state, next: read INTENT/SPEC/ACCEPTANCE and related intents; update sync/STATE focus + plan work, risks: none yet}
