2025-11-27T08:53:28Z {start: booting cdm-ingestion-modes-and-sinks-v1, next: review INTENT/SPEC/AC + run artifacts per RUNCARD}
2025-11-27T09:07:30Z {done: added ingestion config data-mode column + Prisma migration, GraphQL/types/UI now distinguish runMode vs data mode w/ defaults, next: model sink CDM capabilities + validation rules, risks: UI change touches many forms so regression tests needed}
2025-11-27T09:31:56Z {done: added sink capability metadata + GraphQL/UI plumbing (ingestionSinks query, CDM toggle/filtering, validation), next: thread data mode through Temporal + Python worker for CDM mapping, risks: need worker/unit tests to ensure cd m transform path doesn’t regress raw mode}
2025-11-27T10:12:16Z {done: threading data-mode into worker + UI, added sink capability registry/validation; Jira units now map to CDM when requested, next: add tests/docs + ensure ci-check covers raw vs CDM modes, risks: need more coverage so mapping errors don’t slip}
2025-11-27T10:12:45Z {done: wired UI toggle + sink gating; worker now applies Jira→CDM mapping when mode=cdm (raw behavior untouched); pytest test_jira_ingestion passed, next: expand API/UI tests + docs and run broader suites, risks: need sink capability docs/tests to avoid regressions}
2025-11-27T10:25:33Z {done: added Jira CDM transform + unit tests, enforced sink capability validation, documented CDM modes, next: run broader ci-check + update acceptance artifacts, risks: need final verification across stack}
2025-11-27T10:28:52Z {done: ran pnpm ci-check (full stack + Playwright + metadata tests); log at /tmp/ci-check.log, next: final review + acceptance sign-off, risks: none}
