2025-11-20T04:05:02Z {done: boot kb-admin-console-v1 (verified intents/runs), next: gather context (intent/spec/acceptance + existing plan/todo), risks: none}
2025-11-20T05:09:45Z {done: reviewed intent/spec/plan + UI/GraphQL code to scope work, next: add kb GraphQL resolver tests + README doc updates, risks: kb resolvers may need extra fallback handling}
2025-11-20T05:21:13Z {done: added KB GraphQL sample fallback + kbNodes/kbEdges unit coverage (graphResolvers.test.ts), next: wire up KB console UI + e2e coverage, risks: sample graph must not leak into prod (guarded by env flag)}
2025-11-20T07:13:49Z {done: wired Scenes view to search params + added tabular nodes/edges lists with truncation notice and deep links, next: finish Nodes/Edges explorer ADR polish + provenance tab, risks: need e2e coverage for KB scenes nav}
2025-11-20T07:29:14Z {done: added URL-driven lookup + sorted provenance timeline with navigation back to Nodes explorer, next: polish Nodes/Edges explorers (scope/filter UX, toasts) and implement Overview metrics, risks: KB tabs still lack e2e coverage}
2025-11-20T07:43:48Z {done: enhanced KB nodes/edges explorers with highlight + action panels and wired Scenes/Provenance deep links, next: finish Overview metrics + ADR loading polish, risks: Playwright coverage still pending}
2025-11-20T08:16:51Z {done: expanded KB overview metrics (type/edge/scope cards) + linked summaries; nodes/edges drawers now have action buttons + copy toasts, next: integrate ADR loading states + Playwright coverage, risks: overview queries fan out to multiple requests (monitor perf)}
2025-11-20T09:33:44Z {done: added KB Playwright coverage for overview/explorers; attempted headless run (Keycloak login timed out), next: rerun kb tests once auth stack stable + finish state updates, risks: Keycloak not responding during playwright run}
2025-11-20T10:47:16Z {done: auto-ran KB scenes via query param + cleaned icon errors; KB Playwright target still blocked by Keycloak login (500/CORS), next: rerun KB e2e once Keycloak stable then finish state updates, risks: cannot gather KB acceptance evidence without keycloak}
2025-11-20T16:00:13Z {done: KB playwright suite green (overview + explorer actions), next: finalize state/story + slug wrap-up, risks: none}
