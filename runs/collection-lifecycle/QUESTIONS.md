- 2025-11-15: Run card tasks 4–5 require editing the Metadata Console / designer UI (apps/metadata-console or apps/reporting-designer) and wiring the “Trigger collection” button plus Collections tab filters, but this repository only contains the metadata API + Prisma schema. `find . -maxdepth 4 -type d -name '*designer*'` and `rg --files -g '*.tsx'` return nothing, and stack scripts referenced in docs (`scripts/start-designer-bg.sh`, `start-web-bg.sh`, etc.) are missing, so there is no frontend code or dev server to update/test. Without the UI sources and start scripts we cannot implement the required mutations, views, or Playwright e2e coverage for AC2/AC5/AC6. Where do the metadata console/designer files live, or should they be added to this repo so we can complete the feature? *(RESOLVED 2025-11-16: metadata UI now lives under apps/metadata-ui, so frontend work can proceed.)*
