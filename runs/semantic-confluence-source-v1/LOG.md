2025-11-27T19:16:58Z {start: booting semantic-confluence-source-v1, next: review intent/spec + existing confluence artifacts}
2025-11-27T19:36:37Z {done: added runtime Confluence endpoint + metadata subsystem + unit tests, next: wire template into registry/GraphQL + catalog+preview UI, risks: confluence API pagination nuances}
2025-11-27T19:51:04Z {done: confluence template wired into API fixtures + endpoint/adapter tests green, next: flow template through GraphQL/catalog + metadata worker + UI preview, risks: longer metadata integration}
2025-11-27T19:57:49Z {done: captured reference for GraphQL/store wiring + tests still green, next: wire template through GraphQL/worker so catalog sees Confluence datasets, risks: metadata plumbing touches multiple layers}
2025-11-27T19:54:49Z {done: captured reference for GraphQL/store wiring + tests still green, next: wire template through GraphQL/worker so catalog sees Confluence datasets, risks: metadata plumbing touches multiple layers}
2025-11-27T20:05:11Z {done: added metadataEndpointTemplates test + env bypass so HTTP family shows Confluence, next: integrate metadata worker + catalog preview + UI, risks: hooking Temporal/GraphQL}
2025-11-27T20:16:07Z {done: seeded sample Confluence endpoint/dataset + GraphQL/Playwright coverage for doc catalog preview, next: wire metadata worker + actual collection/preview flows, risks: hooking Temporal + API}
2025-11-28T02:57:59Z {done: sample Confluence endpoint/dataset seeded + GraphQL/Playwright coverage proves catalog preview, next: wire real metadata collection & preview flows (planner/worker, API, UI), risks: multiple-layer integration}
2025-11-28T03:45:08Z {done: documented http.confluence in endpoint reference (capabilities+subsystem links), next: wire planner/store/UI for live Confluence metadata collections, risks: multi-layer integration}
2025-11-28T04:05:12Z {done: added Confluence metadata planning test ensuring subsystem schedules space/page/attachment jobs, next: integrate real metadata collection + UI preview flow, risks: multi-layer wiring}
2025-11-28T06:11:16Z {done: taught metadata API to keep template parameters + expose Confluence dataset metadata so ingestion driver sees units (tests added), next: drive metadata worker/GraphQL end-to-end run + polish catalog preview UX, risks: multiple services must agree on catalog schema}
2025-11-28T06:17:57Z {done: added metadata worker collection test proving Confluence snapshots flow into catalog records, next: hook real collection trigger + UI preview polish, risks: aligning Temporal + UI verifications}
2025-11-28T06:22:54Z {done: catalog preview now renders Confluence-friendly cards with excerpts/links (ui+tests updated), next: wire live preview trigger + docs update, risks: ensuring HTML excerpts stay sanitized}
2025-11-28T06:47:55Z {done: prepped resolver hooks for Prisma/Temporal injection; block: TypeScript harness requires ts-node/tsx packages which aren’t available to run the GraphQL-trigger script}
2025-11-28T10:58:00Z {done: built node-based confluence collection harness + guarded catalog auto-preview + limited Jira preview fetch scope, next: run harness w/ real Confluence creds to capture catalog snapshot + wire docs/tests, risks: harness still needs METADATA_AUTH_TOKEN + real endpoint config}
2025-11-28T11:05:47Z {done: attempted harness run via `pnpm metadata:confluence:collect`, blocked because no `http.confluence` endpoint is registered in current metadata store, next: register a Confluence endpoint (seed or real) and re-run harness, risks: need usable Confluence credentials + metadata endpoint config}
2025-11-28T15:03:10Z {done: registered real confluence endpoint + fixed auth clock-skew + Temporal client wiring, harness now collects 3 datasets with artifacts under `.artifacts/confluence-2025-11-28T15-02-40-756Z`, next: wire captured snapshot into docs/tests + verify preview UI w/ live data, risks: Confluence API rate limits when previewing attachments}
2025-11-28T19:56:00Z {done: re-synced repo + reran metadata builds along with pnpm ci-check to confirm stack health, next: document harness evidence + re-verify preview UX end-to-end before closing out acceptance, risks: live preview evidence still needs to be captured in story/STATE}
