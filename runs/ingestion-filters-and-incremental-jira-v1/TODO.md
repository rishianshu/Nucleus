- [x] Extend Prisma `IngestionUnitConfig` + GraphQL schema/resolvers/UI types with optional `jiraFilter` JSON (Jira-specific type), including configure mutation + dataset detail wiring.
- [x] Surface Jira metadata dimensions (projects/users/statuses) via GraphQL queries + UI multi-select inputs; persist selections to config.
- [x] Add KV-backed `TransientState` abstraction (TS + Python) and pass it through ingestion workflow/activity to Jira endpoint units.
- [x] Implement per-project incremental cursors + filter-aware ingestion for Jira issues/comments/... with tests covering new dimension behavior + filter changes.
- [x] Update docs (INGESTION_AND_SINKS, Jira HLD/LLD) + run targeted + full tests (`pnpm ci-check`), logging evidence in LOG/STATE/STORY.
