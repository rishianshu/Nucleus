2025-11-26T09:53:40Z {start: booting ingestion-config-and-jira-units-v1, next: review INTENT/SPEC/ACCEPTANCE + runs artifacts}
2025-11-26T09:55:31Z {done: reviewed INTENT/SPEC/AC + current ingestion state (Prisma lacks unit config, static driver units template only, UI limited to run/pause), next: design data model + backend GraphQL/API changes per plan step 2, risks: migrating Prisma + wiring schedules touches Temporal + UI simultaneously}
2025-11-26T10:37:04Z {done: added Prisma IngestionUnitConfig + migration, extended metadata-core/static driver, overhauled metadata-api schema (new config query/mutation, dataset gating, schedules) and wired Temporal/Python workers to honor config mode/policy, next: update UI (queries, console, dataset view) to surface/manage configs + tie into new GraphQL endpoints, risks: large UI surface area + need to ensure tests mock new mutation}
2025-11-26T11:19:39Z {done: rewired metadata UI (ingestion console drawer + dataset detail ingestion cards), added shared tone helpers, and ran pnpm --filter @apps/metadata-ui typecheck to keep TS happy, next: extend Jira catalog/worker handlers for comments/worklogs + ensure units only surface when cataloged, risks: catalog/worker drift may break ingestion RESUME flow if handlers return mismatched dataset IDs}
2025-11-26T12:33:41Z {done: added Jira comments/worklogs handlers + pytest coverage, created catalog-gating tests, refreshed default template extras, and ran pnpm check:metadata-auth, pnpm check:metadata-lifecycle, pnpm ci-check (all green with stack spin-up/teardown), next: update TODO/STATE artifacts + prep handoff, risks: none (slug ready to close)}

2025-11-26T14:17:26Z {done: restarted dev stack + workers, deleted old Jira endpoint, registered Customer Success Jira via jira.http template, next: run metadata collection to populate catalog + verify datasets, risks: jira API auth rate limits}
2025-11-26T14:28:07Z {done: patched metadata producer adapter so Jira HTTP datasets pass the supports() check, restarted workers, reran Customer Success Jira collections, catalog now shows Jira projects/issues/users/comments/etc via GraphQL, next: configure ingestion units + execute ingestion/verify Temporal+UI, risks: real Jira latency}
2025-11-26T14:50:04Z {done: fixed Jira issue search to use /rest/api/3/search/jql + pagination tokens, refreshed template docs/stubs/tests, merged ingestion policy parameters so python gets base_url, reran jira.issues ingestion successfully (stats show 5 issues, checkpoint updated), next: verify UI/Temporal evidence + KB nodes + Playwright/ci-check runs, risks: lingering legacy collection workflows still spamming SQL errors}
2025-11-26T15:04:49Z {done: rebooted stack after ci-check, re-registered Customer Success Jira (eaac00... ), reran metadata collection + jira.issues ingestion (500 issues synced, KB nodes visible), executed pnpm check:metadata-auth, check:metadata-lifecycle, ci-check successfully, next: update STATE/TODO + summarize findings, risks: temporal collection spam from seeded JDBC placeholders still logging dialect errors}
