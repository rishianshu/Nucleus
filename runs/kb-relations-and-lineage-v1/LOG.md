2025-12-07T03:39:18Z | start | done: booting run | next: read PLAN/LOG/TODO per RESUME protocol | risks: none yet
2025-12-07T03:46:00Z | heartbeat | done: captured scope/acceptance, drafted initial plan in PLAN.md (KB nodes/edges, ingestion, GraphQL/UI, tests) | next: design KB schema changes + IDs/edge labels; map JDBC metadata to KB upserts | risks: none yet
2025-12-07T03:52:27Z | heartbeat | done: added KB meta defaults for catalog.table/column + new edge labels; documented KB IDs/edges in DECISIONS | next: map JDBC metadata to KB upserts (nodes/edges) and update registry/Graph code | risks: keep additive; watch for ID normalization collisions
2025-12-07T04:07:57Z | heartbeat | done: extended KB sink to preserve logicalKey and upsert edges from record.edges; added table/column node/edge defaults | next: map JDBC metadata to emit nodes/edges (logicalIds) and wire registry/Graph code + tests | risks: edge creation depends on logicalId consistency; needs ingestion output update
2025-12-07T04:53:02Z | heartbeat | done: added Postgres constraint details (referenced tables/columns), JDBC KB relation upserts + tests wired via syncRecordToGraph | next: wire GraphQL resolvers/queries for tables/columns and update UI surfaces, run checks | risks: guard limits to postgres only; need to verify dataset payload shapes and GraphStore behaviour at scale
2025-12-07T05:10:56Z | start | done: restart per START_PROMPT; verified intents/runs present | next: reread PLAN/LOG/TODO and resume tasks per RUNCARD; ensure STATE reflects in-progress | risks: keep prior changes aligned with refreshed scope
2025-12-07T08:20:00Z | heartbeat | done: added relation-kind registry, GraphQL tables/doc relations, KB sink doc link edges, queries updated; started pnpm ci-check (timed out after metadata-auth suite build phase) | next: finish ci-check or targeted rerun, surface relation data in UI where minimal; validate GraphQL responses | risks: ci-check incomplete due to timeout; relation resolvers may need further optimization or UI binding
2025-12-07T11:45:40Z | heartbeat | done: reran pnpm ci-check end-to-end (stack up/down, metadata-auth + lifecycle Playwright + mypy all green); verified builds succeed | next: update TODO to close tests, summarize changes, ensure STATE/DECISIONS reflect completion | risks: keep eye on relation coverage for semantic sources in follow-on work
2025-12-07T13:58:53Z | heartbeat | done: added semantic relation emission (attachments, work links, drive hierarchy) + unit tests; adjusted CDM seed pool limit; pnpm ci-check+mypy now green | next: update STATE to success, summarize remaining optional follow-ups (drive_shares_with, UI surfacing) | risks: none noted; further relation surfacing deferred
