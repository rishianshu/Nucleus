2025-11-19T16:08:24Z {done: boot graphstore-identity-hardening, next: review plan/spec, risks: none}
2025-11-19T16:17:59Z {done: reviewed intent/spec + current GraphStore + drafted PLAN/TODO, next: design DDL + storage strategy, risks: unsure if existing metadata record table sufficient for new columns}
2025-11-19T16:45:49Z {done: added GraphNode/GraphEdge models + migration in Prisma schema, next: adapt GraphStore/MetadataStore to use new tables (Prisma + file fallback), risks: GraphStore still tied to metadataRecord path until repository implemented}
2025-11-19T17:57:06Z {done: extended metadata store interfaces, implemented Prisma/file graph repositories, rewrote GraphStore + ingestion to use scope-aware logical keys, next: expose GraphQL identity/scope fields + backfill tooling, risks: new schema not yet wired into GraphQL resolvers/tests}
2025-11-19T18:11:13Z {done: added GraphQL graph types/queries + resolver tests proving scope/identity exposure, next: design backfill tooling + verify integration coverage (AC4), risks: no migration/backfill script yet and GraphQL edges untested end-to-end}
2025-11-19T18:16:27Z {done: built scaffolding for legacy graph backfill script (scope inference + artifact reporting), next: finish CLI wiring/validation + plan backfill execution, risks: script not yet executed against real data and collision reporting minimal}
2025-11-19T18:23:53Z {done: documented + executed new graph backfill CLI (empty dataset run, artifacts emitted under .artifacts), next: connect GraphQL clients/UI to new identity fields and run full integration/Playwright suites, risks: still need end-to-end test sweep for regressions}
2025-11-19T19:00:05Z {done: reran metadata-api/ui unit tests and full metadata-auth Playwright suite with stack running (all green after ensuring API/UI live), next: revisit client/UI exposure of graph identity fields + finalize acceptance package, risks: UI currently not surfacing new graph identity yet}
2025-11-19T19:36:35Z {done: resumed run + ensured instructions loaded, next: finalize slug deliverables (state sync, story update, acceptance verification), risks: need to confirm all artifacts up to date}
2025-11-20T02:53:46Z {done: reloaded AGENT_CODEX/PROMPT template per instruction and prepped to continue, next: proceed with acceptance closure steps, risks: time since last work}
