2025-11-26T19:14:05Z {start: booting metadata-worker-capabilities-and-preview-v1, next: verify run artifacts + update STATE}
2025-11-26T19:23:23Z {done: added capability-driven planner + refactored metadata_worker catalog path, tests: pytest platform/spark-ingestion/tests/test_metadata_planning.py, next: implement HTTP-aware preview dispatch + Jira preview helper, risks: preview requires dataset→endpoint lookup without changing Temporal signatures}
2025-11-26T19:29:11Z {done: wired planner into worker + added Jira preview path (HTTP payload encoding + GraphQL helper) with pytest coverage, next: exercise preview end-to-end + document planner/preview contract + run pnpm checks, risks: need to ensure TS preview encoding doesn\'t break JDBC flows}
2025-11-26T19:40:16Z {done: documented planner+preview contracts and ran pnpm check:metadata-auth, check:metadata-lifecycle, ci-check, next: capture preview evidence + update STATE/story if slug ready, risks: acceptance #2 may need explicit catalog diff if reviewers require it}
