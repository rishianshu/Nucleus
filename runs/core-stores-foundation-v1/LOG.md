2025-12-10T06:21:10Z {start: booting core-stores-foundation-v1, next: read PLAN/TODO/INTENT + SPEC/ACCEPTANCE, risks: none}
2025-12-10T06:38:01Z {done: drafted STORES doc + aligned ingestion/endpoint docs to KvStore/ObjectStore interfaces, next: update STATE/STORY + summarize run, risks: pnpm ci-check failing (ActivityOptions retryPolicy typings in apps/metadata-api/src/temporal/workflows.ts)}
2025-12-10T07:09:46Z {done: fixed retryPolicy→retry in Temporal workflow activities and reran pnpm ci-check (fails on existing Playwright metadata-auth scenarios), next: address failing metadata-auth Playwright cases or document as pre-existing before closing slug, risks: ci-check red due to endpoint connection/seeded data assertions}
2025-12-10T13:23:00Z {done: reran pnpm ci-check after raising workflow/template timeouts; Postgres auth fixed and collection succeeds via Go worker, but ci-check still red (metadata-auth Playwright failures: Postgres template option missing, endpoint delete disabled during run, seeded data not visible, credential regression test), next: decide whether to mark these as pre-existing bugs vs adjust fixtures/seeded endpoints, risks: CI failure blocks acceptance until addressed or documented}
2025-12-10T10:05:52Z {done: hardened start-workers (reclaims UCL port, verifies start), aligned METADATA_PG_* to 5434, mapped cloud.onedrive family to HTTP; reran ci-check → Postgres template visible but form fields missing, collections/credential/seeded work tab still failing (7 tests), next: sanitize endpoint template payloads for UI form fields + fix Postgres connector auth (cdm seed, collections) and rerun ci-check, risks: lingering Postgres auth errors and collection state keep admin delete/test flows blocked}
2025-12-10T17:56:00Z {done: fixed gRPC connectionUrl casing + dialect-aware JDBC connection strings; pnpm ci-check + mypy now green end-to-end (Oracle/MSSQL templates verified), next: close slug and update STATE/STORY/TODO, risks: none}
