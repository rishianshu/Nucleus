1. Document verification for each ACCEPTANCE item (API + UI), capturing evidence from the now-green metadata-auth & metadata-lifecycle runs.
2. Review DOCS (DECISIONS/TODO/QUESTIONS) and clean up or add follow-ups (e.g., pagination TODO) so remaining scope is tracked.
3. Update STATE/STORY + final heartbeat once acceptance confirmed; prep for closure or note any final blockers.
