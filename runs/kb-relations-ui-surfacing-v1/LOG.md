2025-12-07T14:38:44Z | start | done: booted slug kb-relations-ui-surfacing-v1 (verified intents/runs present) | next: read PLAN/LOG/TODO per RESUME, update STATE focus | risks: none yet
2025-12-07T19:46:15Z | heartbeat | done: added kbEdges direction/edgeTypes filters, wired KB edges explorer filters; node explorer now loads scene neighbors grouped (schema/work/docs/drive) | next: polish grouping UI, align compiled JS or rebuild, update Catalog/Docs detail views to use relations, run ci-check | risks: JS build artifacts may lag TSX; need full ci-check after UI updates
2025-12-08T03:07:13Z | heartbeat | done: aligned compiled KB edges explorer with relation-kind multi-select + direction, added neighbor metadata badges from scene edges, fixed KB edge direction filter bug, added kbEdges filter test, ran pnpm ci-check (pass) | next: surface relations in Catalog/Docs/Work detail views and verify semantic relation visibility in UI (Jira/Confluence/OneDrive), update STATE when done | risks: catalog/doc/work relation surfacing not yet reviewed; need UI verification for semantic connectors
2025-12-08T03:37:24Z | heartbeat | done: wired Catalog dataset detail (drawer/page) to show outbound+inbound FKs and related tables from KB relations (PK/FK); JS build still to align | next: align generated JS (or rebuild) to avoid drift, verify UI end-to-end for semantic relations in KB explorer, update STATE/stories when ready | risks: metadata-ui JS file not regenerated; need another ci-check after JS alignment
2025-12-08T04:59:00Z | heartbeat | done: rebuilt metadata-ui to align JS with TSX, reran pnpm ci-check (all green, Playwright + mypy) | next: update STATE/stories to close slug; optional manual UI spot-check for semantic relations | risks: none; stack stopped cleanly
