## Plan
- Re-read SPEC/ACCEPTANCE/RUNCARD to restate UI surfacing goals (KB explorer, Catalog, CDM explorers).
- Add GraphQL support for relation-kind filtered edges/neighbors (bounded pagination).
- Update KB explorer UI: edge-type filters, relation-aware queries, detail panel grouping for new relation kinds.
- Update Catalog (and, time permitting, Docs/Work detail) to pull relations from KB.
- Add/adjust tests (unit/integration/Playwright) and run `pnpm ci-check`.
