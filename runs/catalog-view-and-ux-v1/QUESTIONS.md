- 2025-11-17: To satisfy AC2 (“Catalog dataset list uses pagination / no full-load behavior”) we need to stop the app-wide `catalogDatasets` query that currently fetches every dataset inside `apps/metadata-ui/src/App.tsx` and powers multiple features (metadata workspace, report designer completions, etc.). Can we replace that global fetch with the new paginated connection (and rework the other consumers), or should the catalog console maintain its own paginated fetch while the rest of the app keeps the legacy list? Without clarity we risk breaking the designer and/or still loading the entire catalog, so the pagination work is blocked. **Status:** answered — migrate the entire app to paginated lists (no fetch-all anywhere); designer-specific references are irrelevant.
- 2025-11-18: Unable to complete `pnpm check:metadata-auth` (and single test runs) even after starting Keycloak, metadata API (port 4010), and metadata UI dev servers (port 5176). Playwright still times out waiting for the Keycloak auth redirect (`waitForKeycloakAuth` in tests/helpers/webAuth.ts line 12). Manual run (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=.playwright pnpm exec dotenv -e .env -- npx playwright test tests/metadata-auth.spec.ts:47 --project=chromium`) shows the UI never navigates to `${KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL}/realms/.../protocol/openid-connect/auth` within 15s. Need guidance: is there an additional dev service or environment variable required so the Metadata UI triggers the Keycloak login flow during tests? Without that redirect, the full metadata-auth suite cannot complete.
