2025-11-17T09:26:14Z {done: implemented Prisma searchText + catalogDatasetConnection backend, next: need direction on retiring global catalogDatasets fetch to avoid full-load behavior, risks: breaking other app features by removing shared dataset array}
2025-11-17T10:52:20Z {done: removed legacy designer UI + unused hooks/components per guidance, next: wire metadata workspace to paginated data + new hooks, risks: large UI surface still needs pagination refactor}
2025-11-17T11:06:29Z {done: rewired metadata UI to own paginated dataset query + removed designer context, next: finish catalog detail routing and hook tests, risks: large workspace still needs GraphQL integration tests}
2025-11-17T13:03:11Z {done: routed dataset detail page + catalog pagination UI rewrites, next: finish backend pagination + tests, risks: GraphQL resolver/Playwright coverage pending}
2025-11-17T14:57:13Z {done: catalog UI routing/pagination rewrite, next: finish backend pagination + tests, risks: metadata-auth e2e pending}
2025-11-17T15:44:56Z {done: router rewrite + paginated catalog UI, next: finish backend pagination + tests, risks: metadata-auth e2e pending}
2025-11-17T17:28:16Z {done: booted catalog-view-and-ux-v1 run (AGENT_CODEX loop), next: review PLAN.md/LOG.md/TODO.md + intent files, risks: none}
2025-11-18T02:44:17Z {done: added toast queue + async action instrumentation + dataset detail/endpoint navigation refactors and hook tests, next: wire action hooks into trigger + navigation UI & validate remaining acceptance gaps, risks: need e2e updates for pagination + preview states}
2025-11-18T02:58:27Z {done: updated metadata client + tests to use catalogDatasetConnection pagination, next: tighten backend pagination filters + add ADR coverage for filters/sorting, risks: remaining catalogDatasets legacy callers still exist}
2025-11-18T03:30:20Z {done: added catalog filter unit tests + Prisma filter updates to support endpointId without labels, next: propagate paginated connection usage to remaining GraphQL helpers + Playwright specs, risks: still need integration coverage for pagination states}
2025-11-18T03:53:12Z {done: resumed catalog-view-and-ux-v1 run, next: execute RESUME protocol (PLAN/LOG/TODO) + continue pending tasks, risks: none}
2025-11-18T04:19:16Z {done: implemented shared usePagedQuery hook + tests + catalog hook refactor, next: extend integration coverage (Prisma catalog connection) + Playwright pagination test, risks: need to ensure prisma filters are covered under CI}
2025-11-18T04:24:18Z {done: added generic usePagedQuery hook + catalog pagination tests + extra Playwright coverage for toasts/search filters, next: stabilize Prisma resolver integration tests and run metadata e2e suite, risks: Playwright coverage not yet executed}
2025-11-18T08:33:37Z {done: normalized catalog timestamps + added endpoint search/pagination UI + ran unit/Vitest + attempted metadata-auth Playwright (5 failures remain), next: stabilize Playwright coverage (datasets not visible, ADR error banner expectations) + rerun suite, risks: metadata-auth tests still failing due to new UX + seeding visibility}
2025-11-18T08:37:13Z {done: normalized catalog timestamps + endpoint list pagination/search + reran FE unit tests and Playwright (5 failing cases remain), next: fix Playwright failures (catalog seed visibility, ADR error expectations) and rerun full suite, risks: tests still red until pagination-aware updates land}
2025-11-18T09:21:01Z {done: removed duplicate catalog dataset declarations + added endpoint search/pagination UI; reran unit + metadata-auth tests, next: stabilize Playwright failures (seed visibility, ADR errors) and rerun suite, risks: metadata-auth still red; don't stop until slug green or blocked}
2025-11-18T12:04:41Z {done: resumed catalog-view-and-ux-v1 run, next: follow RESUME protocol (PLAN/LOG/TODO) + continue outstanding tasks, risks: none}
2025-11-18T12:33:50Z {done: fixed dataset detail drawer ReferenceError + updated ADR error spec + reran API/UI/Playwright tests (all green), next: verify catalog UX per AC + prep run artifacts update, risks: remaining manual UX validation pending}
