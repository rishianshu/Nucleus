# Plan

1. Capture plan and assumptions for evaluator scaling.
2. Refactor evaluator to page CDM access and harden unknown-type/error handling.
3. Extend SignalStore/evaluator reconciliation to cover all instances without the 200 cap.
4. Strengthen tests for paging, >200 instances, and definition-level failures; run targeted checks.
5. Update docs plus run artifacts (LOG/STATE/STORY) after verification.
