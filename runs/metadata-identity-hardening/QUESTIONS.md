- 2025-11-16: `pnpm check:metadata-auth` still fails on the “metadata collections filters…” spec because the designer UI hits `/api/graphql` (reporting service) and receives HTTP 400 (“GraphQL request failed”), leaving the page in an error state before we can exercise the metadata filters. Metadata API/UI dev servers are running on :4010/:5177, but we don’t have a reporting backend in this repo. Should we stub `/api/graphql`, run an additional service, or consider this out of scope for metadata-identity-hardening?
- 2025-11-17: Resolved. Product clarified there is only one metadata backend (port 4010) and metadata UI must run on 5176; `/api/graphql` just proxies to the same API. No extra service will be provided.
