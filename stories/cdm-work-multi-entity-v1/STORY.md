# STORY — cdm-work-multi-entity-v1

- 2025-11-30T19:05Z — Finished multi-entity Work Explorer (issues/comments/worklogs/projects/users) plus seeded data + raw payload drawer, verified Jira CDM ingestion end-to-end, and stabilized Playwright (`check:metadata-auth` green); full `ci-check` deferred to the upcoming Confluence/GitHub/OneDrive milestone per user direction.
