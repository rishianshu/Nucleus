# Story — signals-epp-foundation-v1

- 2025-12-11T05:04Z | Completed signals foundation: added Prisma models/migration for signal definitions/instances with seeds, Prisma-backed SignalStore + unit tests, GraphQL schema/resolvers + UI surfacing verified via Playwright, docs recorded (SIGNALS_EPP_MODEL). `pnpm ci-check` now runs full stack (generate/migrate/build/tests/mypy) and passes.
