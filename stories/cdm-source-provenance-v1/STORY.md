# cdm-source-provenance-v1 Story

- 2025-12-11T14:26Z: Added provenance columns (source_id/source_url/raw_source) to CDM work/docs via migrations and sink schemas; updated Jira/Confluence/OneDrive mappers and tests; GraphQL/UI now expose source links + raw source with Open in Source buttons; documented provenance pattern; test attempts noted (cdmResolvers build artifact missing, pytest hit numpy/macOS segfault).
