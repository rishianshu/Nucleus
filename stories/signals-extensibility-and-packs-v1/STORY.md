# Story — signals-extensibility-and-packs-v1

- 2025-12-11T16:32Z | Added implMode/sourceFamily/surfaceHints to SignalDefinition with migrations, introduced evaluator registry plus `cdm.generic.filter` handler and validation, seeded Jira/Confluence DSL packs (DRAFT) and documented extensibility/packs; signals tests blocked in sandbox by tsx IPC (rerun in full env).
- 2025-12-11T16:55:59Z | Resumed run with stack access, reran signalStore/signalEvaluator tests (green after context fix), refreshed extensibility/packs docs with Prisma/GraphQL surfaces and confirmed pack seed migrations; ci-check left for full stack/Playwright window.
